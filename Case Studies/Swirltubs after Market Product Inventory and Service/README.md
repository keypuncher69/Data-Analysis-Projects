# Swirltubs after Market Product Inventory and Service Case Study

Swirltubs is interested in reducing the costs incurred in its after-market warranty service program through stocking parts in the techniciansâ€™ vans while ensuring minimum costs. A holding cost is incurred if a part is stocked on the van, and a revisit cost, if not. The company wants to identify which parts to stock while adhering to the van space constraint of 500 cubic feet. Jim is interested in evaluating the robustness of the recommendation under different levels of uncertain demand.

Developed a stocking recommendation through analysis of parts data, accounting for random demand using 50 replications and computing the Net Benefit per Cubic Foot for each part.
